Summary
[Crazy movie emperor vs humorous little fairy HE 1v1]
He is Qi An, the second-ranked male god in the capital for thousand of years. On screen, he is funny, raucous, hyperactive, and abstinent. In private, he is arrogant, dark-bellied, poisonous, crazy, cruel and has no humanity at all.
Ci Yan inexplicably got cyber-bullied by his fans because she sold that kind of ‘medicine’ to him.
Do you think this is the cruellest?
No, the cruellest is when she went to ask for an explanation, he directly gave her a ‘ticket to
Heaven’, which almost made her pass away on the spot.
She made a bold statement, ‘It would be disrespectful to myself if I didn’t kill him.’
Then, she went on the road to revenge with no return and ended up becoming the leader of the black fans.
Afterward, as they were fighting, somehow, the crazy film emperor had a fit and confessed to her, “How about being with me?”.
Ci Yan: “…”  Not quite right.
This confession frightened her so much that she packed her bags and fled overnight, but before she could leave the door, the man blocked the exit, grabbed her collar, and threatened her coldly: “Do you want to die or live?”
